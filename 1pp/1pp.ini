# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = 1pp brings together the various previously disjointed graphical and mechanical tweaks and components that have accumulated over the years and many more besides, with the aim of providing a refined, polished experience with attention to detail that many felt was lacking in some aspects of Baldur's Gate II compared to its predecessor. This mod changes the paperdolls and inventory icons of Baldur's Gate II to those of Baldur's Gate. The better looking avatars from BG1 are used in BG2. It uses the corrected and better looking female dwarf and gnome avatars with all their armor animations. It adds all armor-animations for thieves to the game (from unarmored to plate mail).
