# 1pp
One Pixel Productions improves the BGII inventory icons.</br></br>

**Author:** Erephine

**Version:** 4.2.0

**Languages:**  English, French

**Platform:** Windows


## Overview

Without a doubt the most comprehensive mod when it comes to post-release QA and visuals, 1pp has been a growing work of love for close to 8 years with the aim of providing a refined, polished experience with attention to detail that many felt was lacking in some aspects of Baldur's Gate II compared to its predecessor. </br></br>
1ppv4 represents the culmination of this effort, bringing together the various previously disjointed graphical and mechanical tweaks and components that have accumulated over the years and many more besides; updated, streamlined and in the form of one coherent installer.</br>

### <a name="101" id="101"></a>[101] 1ppv4: Core paperdolls

Supports: <span style='color:red'>SoA</span>, <span style='color:#700'>ToB</span>, <span style="color:#080;">Tutu</span>, <span style="color:#088;">HoW</span>, <span style="color:#666;">IWDII (placeholder)</span></br>

<img src="1pp/documentation/files/101.jpg"></br>

The component that essentially started it all, this is a port of Baldur's Gate I style paperdolls for the Baldur's Gate II engine (used in SoA/ToB and HoW). Included are reworked 1ppv4 paperdolls for all race/class combinations matching vanilla animations as well as equipped object overlays. New in this version is detection and native support for Infinity Animations, including support for installs of HoW using BG1 animations via the 1pp IWD animation fixpack.

###### Note that this component does not update icon graphics or item colours, so it is not recommended to be installed by itself. It is, however, required for most of the components that follow.</br></br>


### <a name="102" id="102"></a>[102,103] 1ppv4: Extended palette entries

<strong>Non-optional component</strong></br>
Supports: <span style="color:#060">SoA</span>, <span style="color:#700">ToB</span>, <span style="color:#080">Tutu</span>, <span style="color:#088">HoW</span>, <span style="color:#666">IWDII</span></br>

<img src="1pp/documentation/files/102.jpg">

This component adds new colour gradients to Infinity Engine games, raising the count of available colours from 116 to 256. It also includes a new random colour table making use of them for Baldur's Gate II and new colour set files for Icewind Dale II, giving you more skin/hair colour choices for the various races.</br>
It also fixes a few minor problems with standard gradients. <a href="1pp/documentation//files/extpal_readme.html">Read more </a></br></br>

<strong>Compatibility install [102]</strong></br>
For installs that do not support the binary patch (OSX), this installs the basic files needed for 1pp to work properly but does not support using the new colours as character colours.</br></br>

<strong>Full install [103]</strong></br>
Complete install patching the game executable, enabling full use of the extended colour entries.</br>
When installing the full version, extra choices for skin and hair colour will automatically become available from the ingame selection.
As for clothing colours, during character creation and from the inventory the standard complement of 34 primary and secondary colours will be offered. To access more clothing colours, choose 'customise'  'colours' from the character sheet to gain access to yet another set of 34 colours.</br></br>


### <a name="104" id="104"></a>[104] 1ppv4: GUI additions for BGII

Supports: <span style="color:#060">SoA</span>, <span style="color:#700">ToB</span>, <span style="color:#080">Tutu (if using the BG2 GUI)</span></br>

<img src="1pp/documentation/files/104.jpg">

A reworked graphical user interface for Baldur's Gate II SoA/ToB. This aims to get rid of a lot of the rough edges present in the original while maintaining a similar feel. Major changes include a time dial that is not just a box, getting rid of 'infinite parchment' (see additional screenshots) and an optional choice of updated fonts.</br>

### <a name="106" id="106"></a>[106-109] 1ppv4: Female Dwarves

<strong>Requires: <a href="#101">[101]</a></strong></br>
Supports: <span style="color:#060">SoA</span>, <span style="color:#700">ToB</span>, <span style="color:#080">Tutu</span>, <span style="color:#088">HoW</span>, <span style="color:#666">IWDII</span></br>

<a href="1pp/documentation/files/dwarf_readme.html">See more </a></br></br>


### <a name="110" id="110"></a>[110-112] 1ppv4: Thieves Galore

<strong>Requires: <a href="#101">[101]</a> <a href="#106">[106-109]</a></strong></br>
###### Note: Due to the way patching is currently handled, this component will fail if Infinity Animations is already installed. To resolve this issue, install IA after this component.</br>
Supports: <span style="color:#060">SoA</span>, <span style="color:#700">ToB</span>, <span style="color:#080">Tutu</span>, <span style="color:#088">HoW</span>, <span style="color:#666">IWDII</span><</br>

<img src="1pp/documentation/files/110.jpg">

In standard BGII only one armour level of thieves had unique animations (leather armour). Any other armour level would revert to the default unarmoured animation. On the inventory, the first two armour levels had unique paperdolls, anything else would revert to the unarmoured paperdoll.</br>
This component will patch your executable to support full thief animation sequences and install content for them.</br>

<img src="1pp/documentation/files/113.jpg">

This component allows armour and robes to properly show up for characters of any class when equipped. While normally robes would not show up for fighter/cleric/thief animations, and armour would not show up for mage animations, this is circumvented by changing the character animation accordingly while such items are equipped.</br>
<a href="1pp/documentation/files/switch_readme.html">See original readme </a></br></br>


### <a name="114" id="114"></a>[114] 1ppv4: Softer Spell Effects

<img src="1pp/documentation/files/114.jpg">

Substantially improved spell effects with smooth alpha blending for Baldur's Gate II engine based IE games. Note that 3D support has to be enabled for this component to work properly - if you run your game with software rendering mode, it is not recommended to install this.</br>

<img src="1pp/documentation/files/301.jpg">

Contains the following fixes: dog animations (corrupted palette), sitting static peasant woman (bad BAM conversion), alternate fire giant animation slot (was useless as the animation had no unified palette, thus impossible to fill). It also fixes an engine related bug on SoA/ToB and IWD:TotLM that will have helmets randomly render wrong sequences when changing equipment, making them 'float' off your character.  Finally, it contains a fix for bugged shield z-buffering on SoA, ToB, IWD:TotLM and IWDII on BGII character animations.</br></br>
